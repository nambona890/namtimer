A simple timer made in C++20 and SDL2, possibly useful for speedrunners.

General Controls:

= L - Toggles pause and play.

= M - Resets and pauses the timer.
Controls When Paused:

= Left/Right - Moves the cursor left/right (wraps around).

= 0-9 - Sets the selected digit to the pressed number.



Also features a simple UDP control system (7693 by default):

= Sending 'PPPPPPPP' will toggle pause and play.

= Sending 'RRRRRRRR' will reset and pause the timer.
